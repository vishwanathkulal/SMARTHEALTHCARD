# 🏥 Digital Health Card System

A smart, QR-based medical data system designed for **quick access to essential health information**—built using **Python (Flask)** and **PostgreSQL**, deployed via **Render**. This project bridges the gap between healthcare and digital accessibility, enabling users to securely store and retrieve patient records in real-time.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In critical situations, **delays in accessing a patient’s medical information** can result in improper care or life-threatening decisions. Traditional health records are paper-based, fragmented, or inaccessible when most needed. 

This project solves that by:
- 📱 Generating a **Digital Health Card** with a QR code.
- 📤 Storing data like blood group, allergies, emergency contacts, etc., in a secure **PostgreSQL database**.
- ⚡ Enabling instant access to records by scanning the QR code from any device.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Digitize health records for **easy retrieval**.
- ✅ Ensure **real-time access** to medical details during emergencies.
- ✅ Offer a **simple UI** for both data input and display.
- ✅ Use **QR codes** for fast, secure, and shareable patient identification.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 📝 Form-based health data submission.
- 🧾 Unique **QR code generation** for each card.
- 🧠 Information includes: name, blood group, emergency contact, allergies, etc.
- 🔒 Secure storage using PostgreSQL.
- 🌐 Works across **desktop and mobile browsers**.
- 🔗 QR codes contain secure, route-based identifiers (`/display/<card_id>`).

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```

User ➝ Flask Form ➝ PostgreSQL ➝ QR Generation ➝ QR Code Output

```
                       ↓
                     QR Scan
                       ↓
        /display/<card_id> ➝ Fetch & Render Details
```

```

├── Procfile                # Render deployment

```

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User fills out a form** with health details.
2. **Unique card ID is generated**, QR code is created.
3. **Data is saved** in PostgreSQL with the associated `card_id`.
4. **QR code displays** a URL like `/display/<card_id>`.
5. **Scanning** the QR shows the health details securely.

---

## ✅ Results

- 🔐 Unique, scannable QR for each patient.
- 📱 Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop.
- 🧪 Fully tested on **Render** and **localhost** deployments.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                              | Solution                                |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| QR showing old data                    | Refactored routes to fetch dynamic IDs  |
| Localhost-only QR scanning             | Deployed on Render for public access    |
| QR overwriting on new card generation  | Used `card_id` as QR image filename     |

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Render)

- Pushed code to GitHub.
- Used `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` for setup.
- Set Python version to 3.10+.
- Public QR scanning enabled with hosted URL.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🔐 Add login for verified healthcare professionals.
- 📋 Include prescriptions and full medical history.
- 📊 Admin dashboard for hospital use.
- 🧾 Export health card as downloadable PDF.
